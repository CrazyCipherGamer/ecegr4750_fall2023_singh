# ECEGR4750 Final Project

## File structure

Note: The format is identical to the one listed in the final project instructions PDF. The only thing of note is the new folder named model_losses which stores the losses recorded for the final instance of training. This allows analysis.ipynb to run all the way through without needing to retrain the models.
Furthermore, this ensures that the image one sees in the notebook match those of the final report.
